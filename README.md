# Premier League App
Premier League App is a desktop application that is actually a web-scraper that extracts data from the HTML inner texts of Premier League official website and shows them on graphic windows.

## Project Description
This app that I developed in the summer of 2021 was actually the first project that I did from the idea to its full implementation. At first, it was supposed to be just a web-scraper for the final project of the Python course that prints data in the terminal, but I tried to develop it using various Python graphic tools and libraries to show the data in a more favorable and user-friendly way.
